        <h1>Potato Salad</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Born vegan, this is a classic potato salad that can be found on Italian tables from the North to the South. In Italy, you'll find it everywhere: formal luncheons, family get-togethers, weeknight dinners, and even in hospital and school cafeterias. Many Italians add cooked green beans. Leftovers are delicious tossed with pesto and pasta. Buon appetito!</p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil. Cook until
            potatoes are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to break the potatoes.
        </p>
